    "Ans2. Four different types of issues where Machine Learning works are given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1).Identifying Spam : Spam identification is one of the most basic applications of machine learning. Most of our email inboxes also have an unsolicited, bulk, or spam inbox, where our email provider automatically filters unwanted spam emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do they know that the email is spam?\n",
    "\n",
    "They use a trained Machine Learning model to identify all the spam emails based on common characteristics such as the email, subject, and sender content. If you look at your email inbox carefully, you will realize that it is not very hard to pick out spam emails because they look very different from real emails. Machine learning techniques used nowadays can automatically filter these spam emails in a very successful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spam detection is one of the best and most common problems solved by Machine Learning. Neural networks employ content-based filtering to classify unwanted emails as spam. These neural networks are quite similar to the brain, with the ability to identify spam emails and messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making Product Recommendations : Recommender systems are one of the most characteristic and\n",
    "ubiquitous machine learning use cases in day-to-day life. These systems are used everywhere by search engines, e-commerce websites (Amazon), entertainment platforms (Google Play, Netflix), and multiple web & mobile apps.These recommender systems allow businesses to drive more traffic, increase customer engagement, reduce churn rate, deliver relevant content and boost profits. All such recommended products are based on a machine learning model’s analysis of customer’s behavioral data. It is an excellent way for online retailers to offer extra value and enjoy various upselling opportunities using machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis : Sentiment analysis is one of the beneficial and real-time machine learning\n",
    "applications that help determine the emotion or opinion of the speaker or the writer. For instance, if you’ve written a review, email, or any other form of a document, a sentiment analyzer will be able to assess the actual thought and tone of the text. This sentiment analysis application can be used to analyze decision-making applications, review-based websites, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Image & Video Recognition : Machines are good at processing images, Machine Learning algorithms\n",
    "can train Deep Learning frameworks to recognize and classify images in the dataset with much more accuracy than humans.Similar to image recognition, companies such as Shutterstock, eBay, Salesforce, Amazon, and Facebook use Machine Learning for video recognition where videos are broken down frame by frame and classified as individual digital images."

You find the best hyperparameter value gives you 5% generalization error.\n",
